Get a markdown version of any webpage with a keyboard shortcut.[^1]

## Installation

## Usage

1. Open a webpage
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+O` (or `Cmd+Shift+O` on macOS) to trigger the extension
3. The contents of the page will be converted to markdown and copied to your clipboard

You will get a notification in the upper right corner of the screen that looks like this:

## Changing The Keyboard Shortcut

To change the keyboard shortcut, open Chrome's extensions page, click on the "Manage" button for this extension, click on "Keyboard shortcuts", and change the shortcut from "Ctrl+Shift+O" to whatever you'd like.

You can also modify the `manifest.json` file to change the shortcut.  Look for the `commands` section.
